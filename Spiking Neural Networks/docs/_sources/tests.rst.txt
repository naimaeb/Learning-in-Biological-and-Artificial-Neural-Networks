You may execute the provided (public) test cases to check your code from the root directory of the repository using the command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/public -t ./
  
You may add the option `-v` to the command above to have more information displayed while testing.

**Note**, the course instructors will have a very similar set of *private* test cases that are used to grade submissions. **Please ensure that all functionalities are implemented as required by the** :ref:`API <api-reference-label>` **and use these test cases only as a sanity-check.**
