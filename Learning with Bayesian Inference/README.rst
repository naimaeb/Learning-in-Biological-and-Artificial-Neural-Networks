In this tutorial, you will be implementing parts of the Bayes-by-backprop 
algorithm by completing missing parts in the module :mod:`lib.utils`. 
The theory to derive at the forumlas that need to be implemented were subject
to the exercise and tutorial.

Assignment 3
###############################

In the tutorial sessions you have seen
how to derive the ELBO (Evidence lower bound). 
In this exercise, you are going to implement the ELBO for the simple case 
of factorized (independent) Gaussian weights in your Artificial Neural Networks.

Please refer to the :ref:`API <api-reference-label>` to get an overview of the 
coding structure.

You can see your code in action by learning a simple regression
task via the script :mod:`main`. 
Please study the command-line arguments on how to use the script.

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3 main.py --help

To visually certify the quality of the obtained predictions, you can
visualize the results of a 1D regression task via

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3 main.py
  
We recommend playing around with command-line options such as 
the number of weight samples (only for testing) ``--weight_samples`` and 
``--num_train_samples`` in combintation of turning Bayes-by-backprop on and off
i.e. ``--bbb`` (if implemented correctly).
